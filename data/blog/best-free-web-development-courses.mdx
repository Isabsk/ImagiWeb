Before diving into the list of free web development courses, let’s know what web development is.

[**Web development**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-development/) **is the process of building and managing websites.** It includes tasks like designing the site, coding it, and organising content.

Web developers use languages like **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to create how a website looks and works. They make sure the site is easy to use, looks good, and is easy to find on search engines.

There are [three main types of web developers](https://madcapmarketing.com/the-three-types-of-web-developers-and-what-they-do/), each specialising in a different part of the website-building process. They are -

*   **Front-End Developers** – They focus on the visual parts of a website, building everything users see and interact with, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
*   **Back-End Developers** – They work on the server-side, handling databases, servers, and applications that make the website function behind the scenes.
*   **Full-Stack Developers** – They do both front-end and back-end tasks, managing the entire website from design to functionality.

In short, web development is crucial for creating a strong online presence and giving users a smooth experience.
